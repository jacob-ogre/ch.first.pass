## Background

Critical habitat occupies a contentious position in endangered species policy
(see, e.g., [James and Ward 2016](http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalp34&div=4&id=&page=)).  Although much has been written about the
intent, scope, and effectiveness of critical habitat designations ([Gibbs and Currie 2012](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035730); [Mullen, Peterson and Todd 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kaitlyn_Mullen/publication/257163227_Has_designating_and_protecting_critical_habitat_had_an_impact_on_endangered_North_Atlantic_right_whale_ship_strike_mortality/links/54de0d2b0cf22a26721e2690.pdf); [Nelson et al. 2015](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.717.6236&rep=rep1&type=pdf); [Taylor, Suckling and Rachlinski 2005](http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/4/360.full)), very little is known about its current ecological
condition. This knowledge gap makes it difficult, if not impossible, to
understand whether the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is adequately
protecting critical habitat or the extent to which critical habitat is
furthering recovery. 

In this working document, we test the hypothesis that
remotely-sensed data--particularly the National Land Cover Database (NLCD)--can
help close this pervasive knowledge gap by providing estimates of the extent of
habitat changes over a 10-year period within designated critical habitat. 
Using a set of 42 ESA-listed species with critical habitat
designated before 2000, we calculate the change in acreage of potentially
suitable land cover types during the period 2001-2011. We expect that high rates
of land cover change and declining species status signal inadequate protection
of critical habitat, and may reveal instances of "destruction or adverse
modification." Conversely, we expect that low rates of land cover conversion and
high species recovery indicate appropriate levels of protection. Our 
_preliminary results_ indicate that most of the 42 listed species have not 
witnessed significant critical habitat losses during the study period. 

## Methods

To test our hypothesis, we first created a list of all ESA-listed species with
critical habitat designated before 2001. Because of the complexities of linking
land cover changes to aquatic critical habitat, we eliminated fishes from the 
list. Last, we removed species for which habitat disturbance was not the primary 
threat to their recovery, e.g., wolves (threatened by hunting) and condors 
(threatened by lead). The filtered list of 42 species with critical habitat 
designated before 2000 included plants, invertebrates, mammals, birds, and herps.

We used only publicly available data for our analyses, including:

- critical habitat, provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service through its
Environmental Conservation Online System, [ECOS](http://ecos.fws.gov)); and 

- the  National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provided by the Multi-Resolution Land 
Characteristics Consortium, [MRLC](http://www.mrlc.gov/finddata.php)). 

Within the NLCD, we used several products, including: 

- 2001 Land Cover (2011 edition), 

- 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 editon), 

- 2011 Land Cover, 

- 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness, and 

- 2001-2011 Land Cover From To Change Index. 

We made a geodatabase of critical habitat with a seperate feature
class for each of our 42 case study species. Using ArcGIS Model Builder, we
clipped each of the NLCD products to each of the feature classes (i.e., 5
rasters for each of our case study species). For the land cover products, we
used arcpy scripts to calculate the percent cover (2001 and 2011), the total
acreage change, and the percent acreage change of each land cover type for each
feature class. For the percent developed imperviousness, we used arcpy scripts
to calculate the total number of acres with > 50% developed imperviousness
for 2001 and 2011 for each of our 42 species. Those numbers were used to
calculate total and percent acreage change in imperviousness.

## Results

To provide context, we first present two examples of the NLCD layers within 
polygons of designated critical habitat:

<hr>

##### Ex. 1. Mount Graham red squirrel habitats in 2001 (top) and in 2011 (bottom) after the large wildfires of 2004.

Green is evergreen forest; tan and whitish are shrub/scrub and grassland.

##### Ex. 2. Least Bell's Vireo habitat in CH in 2001 (top), 2011 (middle), and the change in habitats from 2001-2011 (bottom).

Reds are classified as development of varying intensity; shades of brown and
gray are 'natural' habitat.

### _Species_

```{r one, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
no_chg <- filter(all_sp, from == to)
change <- filter(all_sp, from != to)

chg_by_sp <- tapply(change$Acres,
                    INDEX = change$Species,
                    FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
sme_by_sp <- tapply(no_chg$Acres,
                    INDEX = no_chg$Species,
                    FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)

# And set up the data frame...
by_spp <- data.frame(Species = names(chg_by_sp),
                     chg_by_sp = as.vector(chg_by_sp))
tmp_sp <- data.frame(Species = names(sme_by_sp),
                     sme_by_sp = as.vector(sme_by_sp))
by_spp <- full_join(by_spp, tmp_sp, by = "Species")
by_spp$sp_total <- by_spp$chg_by_sp + by_spp$sme_by_sp
by_spp$chg_pct <- (by_spp$chg_by_sp / by_spp$sp_total) * 100
by_spp <- arrange(by_spp, desc(chg_pct))
```

The percentage of critical habitat that changed from one NLCD class to another
ranged from `r round(min(by_spp$chg_pct, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)` to `r round(max(by_spp$chg_pct, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)` per species. The average
amount of change was `r round(mean(by_spp$chg_pct, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)`%
(median = `r round(median(by_spp$chg_pct, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)`%). 

```{r two, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE }
plot_a <- plot_ly(data = by_spp,
                  x = by_spp$Species,
                  y = by_spp$chg_pct, 
                  type = "bar",
                  marker = list(color = substr(viridis(1), 0, 7))) %>%
          layout(xaxis = list(title = "", tickangle = 60), 
                 yaxis = list(title = "% CH changed"), 
                 margin = list(b = 160))

plot_b <- plot_ly(by_spp,
                  x = by_spp$Species,
                  y = by_spp$chg_by_sp, 
                  type = "bar",
                  marker = list(color = substr(viridis(1), 0, 7))) %>%
          layout(xaxis = list(title = "", tickangle = 60), 
                 yaxis = list(title = "CH changed (acres)"), 
                 margin = list(b = 160))

# subplot(plot_a, plot_b, margin = 0.05, nrows = 2) %>% 
#     layout(title = "CH changes by percent (top) and area (bottom)", 
#            showlegend = FALSE)
htmltools::tagList(list(plot_a, plot_b))
```

#### _Note_
The habitat changes for the three species with the highest percentage 
change are mostly attributable to fires. Some of the changes within the Amargosa 
vole (#4, by percent) habitat are beneficial, e.g., shrub/scrub to emergent 
wetland vegetation.

<hr>

The proportions of habitat transitions varies by species. For example, the Mt.
Graham red squirrel had the largest proportion of its habitat change, primarily
because of large fire in 2004:

```{r sp_squirrel, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
make_heatmap(all_sp, "MountGrahamRedSquirrel", "MountGrahamRedSquirrel")
```

Whooping crane, which saw 3%, or >11,000 acres, of habitat change within
critical habitat:

```{r sp_whcr, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
make_heatmap(all_sp, "WhoopingCrane", "WhoopingCrane")
```

We include the from:to habitat transitions for all 42 species evaluated in an
[Appendix](#appendix).

### _Habitats_

We next asked if there were systematic habitat transitions across species.
_Note_ that the percentages are calculated over the area within CH designations,
not the total extent of the habitat type in the US.

```{r three, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
all_hab <- tapply(all_sp$Acres,
                  INDEX = all_sp$from,
                  FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
chg_fr_hb <- tapply(change$Acres,
                    INDEX = change$from,
                    FUN = function(x) -sum(x, na.rm = TRUE))
chg_to_hb <- tapply(change$Acres,
                    INDEX = change$to,
                    FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)

# And set up the data frame...
tot_hab <- data.frame(habitat = names(all_hab),
                      tot_hab = as.vector(all_hab))
by_hab <- data.frame(habitat = names(chg_to_hb),
                     chg_to_hb = as.vector(chg_to_hb))
tmp_hb <- data.frame(habitat = names(chg_fr_hb),
                     chg_fr_hb = as.vector(chg_fr_hb))
by_hab <- full_join(by_hab, tmp_hb, by = "habitat")
by_hab <- full_join(by_hab, tot_hab, by = "habitat")
by_hab$net_chg <- by_hab$chg_fr_hb + by_hab$chg_to_hb
by_hab$chg_pct <- (by_hab$net_chg / by_hab$tot_hab) * 100
by_hab <- arrange(by_hab, desc(chg_pct))
```

```{r four, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}

plot_a <- plot_ly(by_hab,
                  x = by_hab$habitat,
                  y = by_hab$chg_pct, 
                  type = "bar",
                  marker = list(color = substr(viridis(1), 0, 7))) %>%
          layout(xaxis = list(title = "", tickangle = 60), 
                 yaxis = list(title = "% CH changed"), 
                 margin = list(b = 160))

plot_b <- plot_ly(by_hab,
                  x = by_hab$habitat,
                  y = by_hab$net_chg, 
                  type = "bar",
                  marker = list(color = substr(viridis(1), 0, 7))) %>%
          layout(xaxis = list(title = "", tickangle = 60), 
                 yaxis = list(title = "CH changed (acres)"), 
                 margin = list(b = 160))

# subplot(plot_a, plot_b, margin = 0.05, nrows = 2) %>% 
#     layout(title = "CH changes by percent (top) and area (bottom)", 
#            showlegend = FALSE)
htmltools::tagList(list(plot_a, plot_b))

```

To see which habitat was converted to which habitat, we can create a heatmap. 
Note that the acres are log10-transformed because the area of `shrub/scrub` is 
so large relative to other areas:

```{r five, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
make_heatmap(all_sp, "", "All species")
```

<hr>

**We leave this working paper here - without a Discussion - because the results are incomplete. We will update this document as we collect and analyze more data in 2017.**

<hr>

## Appendix

To facilitate species-by-species evaluation of habitat changes, we provide
'from:to' heatmaps for each of the 42 species in the dataset:

```{r appendix_spp, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=210, warning=FALSE}
plots <- list()
un_sp <- unique(all_sp$Species)
for(i in 1:length(un_sp)) {
  plots[[i]] <- make_heatmap(all_sp,
                             species = un_sp[i],
                             title = un_sp[i],
                             height = 600)
}
htmltools::tagList(plots)
```
